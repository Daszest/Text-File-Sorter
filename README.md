# Text-File-Sorter
Sorts a text file based on what you are looking for
Was a university project that I did for softeng 251 - Object Oriented Design
I used object oriented design to create a program that could sort a text file with information about the dependencies in another program
The main aim of the project was not to have the most efficient running time but to create a solution that could be easily understood, so some of the code in this project will not be the most efficient.
